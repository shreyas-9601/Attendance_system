                <p> Today attendance is the most important thing to record the presence of someone. 
                    The presence of someone in an organization is a sign that theperson is carrying
                    out their obligations to come to the agency or organization.
                </p>
                <p>Usually, attendance is done manually. It can be signed or called one by one. 
                    In this digital age, there must be a change from this absence to be able to accelerate
                    and provide time efficiency. We can use face recognition to record attendance from 
                    everyone present in an organization.
                </p>
                <p>In this face recognition, many algorithms are
                    performed to dissect and capture images of someone’s face, such as Machine Learning and 
                    Deep Learning. With this algorithm, the system can recognize a person’s face and record
                    attendance from that person so that attendance activities are more efficient and faster.
